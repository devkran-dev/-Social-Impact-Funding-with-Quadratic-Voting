# Social Impact Funding with Quadratic Voting

## Project Description

A decentralized platform that enables communities to fund social impact projects through a fair and democratic quadratic voting mechanism. This blockchain-based solution ensures that smaller donors have meaningful influence while preventing wealthy individuals from dominating funding decisions.

The platform allows project creators to submit social causes for funding, while contributors can vote using their cryptocurrency contributions. The unique quadratic voting system calculates voting power as the square root of the contribution amount, creating a more equitable distribution of influence.

## Project Vision

To democratize social impact funding by creating a transparent, fair, and decentralized platform where:

- **Every voice matters**: Quadratic voting ensures smaller contributors have proportional influence
- **Transparency is guaranteed**: All transactions and voting records are permanently stored on the blockchain
- **Communities decide**: Projects are funded based on genuine community support rather than just capital
- **Global accessibility**: Anyone with cryptocurrency can participate in funding social causes worldwide
- **Efficient allocation**: Funds are automatically distributed based on voting results without intermediaries
